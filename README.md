# Pizza-Delivery-Project
Project 1 for GA SEIR Hypatia. Browser game that allows you to deliver pizzas, receive tips, refuel your gas tank, and receive warnings from your boss if you deliver the wrong pizza. There's also a secret button to help you win. 

Started with Cached Dom Nodes that reference the HTML

Created Global Vars that included the pizza arrays (for ordered and delivered); images.

Created a class of Driver that had many methods, many of which call other methods. 

Created other functions relating to how the game looks and operates, including event listeners and a secret win button
